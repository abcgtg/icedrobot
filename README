Welcome to the IcedRobot project!

This is the higher level source repository, if you got this tree from ika,
then you don't need anything else to start working, otherwise you may
need to download the rest of the sources (the directories you see may
be empty placeholders).

The easiest way to grab the whole source distribution is to use ika:

$ ika init --dest=icedrobot-dev

where dest can really be anything you like of course.

You need ika to build some of the resource files (namely the logtags classes),
but if you don't like ika (but I can't seriously believe that!) then you can
still manually grab all the sub repositories, you will find the list in
the .ika.properties file in this same directory.

To build you can use the makefile:

$ make

This will build all.

You need ika as said before, but also a couple of tools from the Android SDK
that we still don't compile and distribute ourselves: aidl aapt.

They need to be in the path.

Have fun!
